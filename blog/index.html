    <h3>Welcome to the Show</h3>
    <p>I am writing to say thanks for stopping by. Hope you had fun and tried
      the cake. Writing code is great. I'm eager to do more and more. But, as
      much as I rave about the joy of it all I do stubble, get stuck, stop for
       bathroom breaks that turn into mini vacations. I continue to press on
       this journey. The hardest part is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>stick to my own schedule and deadline</li>
  <li>knowing when to take a break</li>
  <li>not getting discourgaed</li>
</ol>
<p>If I can begin to tackle these feats.
   Then I can have 'real' developer problems. Like resolving algorithms to make
    a smother user experience. Or hunting down annoying bugs that attack the whole site.

      <p>This is a real journey. For me, this often feels like a hero's quest. I am searching for a grand treasure. This is my destiny. But with all quest
        there are dragons and beast. The last couple of days I have been stuck on a getting my pages to link together. And today was the day I finally tamed the beast.
      </p>
      <p>I figured out how to link the sites. And I am so happy. I am ready for the next adventure.</p>

  <h3>Lemons made me a Developer</h3>
</div>
<div class="half-width">
  <p>2020 has been full of lemons. Every lemon I have squeezed into working on my programing skills.
  I put all my frustration and anxiety cause by life in to working. And It is not always negativity. Somwtimes I feel amazing when
I get the desire tode. </p>
<p>Instead of letting myself quit. I take my lemons and write code. And I have to say thank you to the lemons</p>
